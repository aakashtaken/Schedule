# Schedule
Schedule for tasks and priorities. 
This is my first project ever with Python. 
In this project I intend to make use of libraries such as Openpyxl, PIL and Django.
Intention of this project is to create a schedule/to do list with sticky notes on a background image of my choice. The sticky notes are goign to be colored between green, yellow and red. Data will be input through Excel and later pasted on the image using PIL. Django is included to involve this project on a webserver, in this case it will be our localhost.
